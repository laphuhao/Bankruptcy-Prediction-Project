# Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Introduction:
Predicting the financial health of companies and firms has become a key interest for their owners, creditors, and all stakeholders alike, especially now that huge amounts of financial data can be stored and analyzed on computers.

The purpose of a predictive model that tries to foresee bankruptcy is to combine various econometric parameters that can effectively gauge a company's financial state and enable management to take pre-emptive measures that can potentially help avoid any financial distress to the company.

In this project, I have employed some of the most widely used classification algorithms for this project namely;

1. **`Logistic Regression`**
2. **`Decision Tree`**
3. **`Random Forest`**
4. **`Support Vector Machine`**

## Dataset:
The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the Taiwan Stock Exchange business regulations.

## Results:
Each model's performance is evaluated through an accuracy score, and the best-performing model is Random Forest, which achieves an accuracy of **96.92%**.

## Conclusion:
This project provides a framework for predicting a company's bankruptcy using machine learning algorithms. The best-performing model can be used as a reference for future projects with similar objectives.
