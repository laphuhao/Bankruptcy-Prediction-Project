# Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Introduction:
Bankruptcy detection is a major topic in finance. Indeed, for obvious reasons, many actors such as shareholders, managers or banks are interested in the likelihood of bankruptcy of firms.
So, I decide applying several advanced Machine Learning techniques including **`Logistic Regression`**, **`Decision Tree`**, **`Random Forest`**, **`Support Vector Machine`** algorithms to predict the bankruptcy of companies in Taiwan from 1990 to 2009. 

## Dataset:
The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the Taiwan Stock Exchange business regulations.

## Results:
The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, and the best-performing model is Random Forest, achieving an accuracy of 92.96%.

## Conclusion:
This project provides a framework for predicting a company's bankruptcy using machine learning algorithms. The best-performing model can be used as a reference for future projects with similar objectives.
