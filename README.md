# Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Introduction:
Predicting the financial health of companies and firms has become a key interest for their owners, creditors, and all stakeholders alike, especially now that huge amounts of financial data can be stored and analyzed on computers.

The project's goal is to utilize machine learning classification algorithms to predict bankruptcy and select the most effective model to help the company anticipate financial distress.

In this project, I have employed some of the most widely used classification algorithms for this project namely

1. **`Logistic Regression`**
2. **`Decision Tree`**
3. **`Random Forest`**
4. **`Support Vector Machine`**

## Dataset:
The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the Taiwan Stock Exchange business regulations.

**`Kaggle`**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction

## Results:
Each model's performance is assessed using an accuracy score. The Random Forest model achieves the highest accuracy, with an impressive score of **96.48%**.

## Conclusion:
This project provides a framework for predicting companies' bankruptcy using machine learning algorithms. The best-performing model can be used as a reference for future projects with similar objectives.
